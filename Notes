- Create constant variables for ids such as champions, icons, season etc (Connect champion name to its ID)
- Look into a more permanent API key (only lasts for the day)
- Access specific data from matches (create list):

Kills, Deaths, Assists, Wards, Healing etc

- Need to get the participant ID for the data on each player in a game.
- Create GUI. Search bar with options for region. Then display like a league profile.
- Maybe use libavg for GUI.
